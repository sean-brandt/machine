# Docker Machine + Parallels driver

This is a fork of [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) repository
with added support of Parallels Desktop for Mac.
This is a temporary solution for those who want to use Docker Machine with
Parallels Desktop today, since our Pull-Request has not been merged to upstream.

We expect that an official support of `parallels` driver will be available in
Docker Machine v0.5.0, when the new plugin model will be implemented.

## Requirements
* OS X 10.9 of later
* Parallels Desktop 11 Pro or Business edition.
* Docker Client (can be installed with [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox))

## Installation

In order to use Docker Machine with Parallels Desktop you should install our
custom `docker-machine` binary:

```console
$ curl -L https://github.com/Parallels/docker-machine/releases/download/parallels%2F0.4.0/docker-machine_darwin-amd64 > /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
```

**NB!** This is a replacement for the official `docker-machine` binary. If you
will install or update "Docker Toolbox" in the future, it could override this
binary and you migth want to re-download it again.

## Usage
Official documentation for Docker Machine [is available here](https://docs.docker.com/machine/).

To create a Parallels Desktop virtual machine for Docker purposes just run this
command:

```
$ docker-machine create --driver=parallels prl-dev
```

Available options:

 - `--parallels-boot2docker-url`: The URL of the boot2docker image.
 - `--parallels-disk-size`: Size of disk for the host VM (in MB).
 - `--parallels-memory`: Size of memory for the host VM (in MB).
 - `--parallels-cpu-count`: Number of CPUs to use to create the VM (-1 to use the number of CPUs available).

The `--parallels-boot2docker-url` flag takes a few different forms. By
default, if no value is specified for this flag, Machine will check locally for
a boot2docker ISO. If one is found, that will be used as the ISO for the
created machine. If one is not found, the latest ISO release available on
[boot2docker/boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker) will be
downloaded and stored locally for future use. Note that this means you must run
`docker-machine upgrade` deliberately on a machine if you wish to update the "cached"
boot2docker ISO.

This is the default behavior (when `--parallels-boot2docker-url=""`), but the
option also supports specifying ISOs by the `http://` and `file://` protocols.

Environment variables and default values:

| CLI option                    | Environment variable        | Default                  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| `--parallels-boot2docker-url` | `PARALLELS_BOOT2DOCKER_URL` | *Latest boot2docker url* |
| `--parallels-cpu-count`       | `PARALLELS_CPU_COUNT`       | `1`                      |
| `--parallels-disk-size`       | `PARALLELS_DISK_SIZE`       | `20000`                  |
| `--parallels-memory`          | `PARALLELS_MEMORY_SIZE`     | `1024`                   |
